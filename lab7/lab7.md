# Due: Dec 8


## Starter file and tester

* Starter file lab7.h
* tester: lab7tester.cpp

## Add functions to bst

Implement the following 3 member functions:

```c++
void remove(const T& data);
```
* function removes the node containing data

```c++
int depth(const T& data);
```
* function returns the depth of the node with value of data.  If no such node exist function returns -1

```c++
BST(const BST& rhs);
```
* copy constructor duplicates rhs into current object

## Submitting your lab

In order to get a mark for this lab, you must submit:
* a successful pull request (or push) of your la7.cpp file into main branch with a successful build step
* your code via github in the main branch of your repo (in the lab7 folder)


Please make sure you follow the steps listed below fully

### A successful pull request or push of your lab7.h file into the main branch

This step is similar to what you did in lab1, just with lab7 files instead.


### Submitting your code on github

* submit lab7.h
* Do not alter the structure of the files in your lab repositories in any way.
* Do not add extra folders.
* Do not add extra files.  
* Do not upload an entire VS solution.

  
All branches should be pushed to your private btp500 github repos (These were provided by completing lab 0).  **DO NOT** put it in your own public repo as  **that would violate academic policy (cheating)**

## Lab Rubric:

| Criteria | Poor - 0 mark | Fair - 0.5 marks | Good - 1 marks| 
|---|---|---|---|
| Lab Completion | Successful PR with successful build not submitted or code submitted but analysis and reflection component is missing | Successful PR but Reflection/analysis is incomplete or lacks detiails | A good attempt at completing all parts of the lab, may have some small flaws |
